                <p>
                    RSU stands for Restricted Stock Units. They are a promise of future stock, meaning they cannot be used immediately, 
                    instead they are vested when reaching certain milestones. When vested the employee receives the stocks.  (Ex. Every 6 months for the next two years)

                    Stock options are another form of compensation given to employees by the employer. They give the employee 
                    the right to purchase a certain amount of company's shares for a set price, this price is often discounted but not always. 
                    They usually aren't all available right away and are given out over a set period of time agreed upon in the job offer.

                    usually up to a certain percentage, to incentivize savings.

                <p>
                    A severance package is compensation or benefits that are provided if your employment is terminated. 
                    A typical severance package may have a few weeks of salary or a continuation of benefits for a temporary time after termination.
                    These packages can vary depending on the employer
